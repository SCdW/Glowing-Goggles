# Identifying Required Products in a Code Base

This example shows the different approaches for identifying which MathWorks products are used in a code base and the pros and cons of each.  To get started, open the  `WhichProductsAreUsed.mlx` live script in this repository.

The three approaches evaluated are:

* Checking `>>license inuse` after running code
* Dependency Analysis in a Project
* `requiredFilesAndProducts` (not recommended)
